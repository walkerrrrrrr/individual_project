## Winter semester

* **Week 1**
  
  * 1PM on Tuesday
  * Meeting content:
    * The differences and advantages and disadvantages of Channel-Based Languages and Mailbox are discussed: in particular, Go and Erlang languages, which coordinate concurrent computation by means of explicit message passing. We compare the differences between channel-based languages (Go) and languages based on the Actor model (e.g., Erlang), including differences in message-passing methods, data locality, and so on.
    * The basic syntax of Erlang is briefly explained: we discuss the basic syntax and concepts of Erlang as a language that supports the Actor model. This included basic concepts such as the notion of Actor, message passing, and mailboxes (Mailbox).
    * Demonstrated a case study on Future : We demonstrated a case study on Future through sample code. In this case, we modeled a Future variable and showed how to handle message passing and state transitions in concurrent computation.
    * Introduced the Pat programming language's type checker: We explored the Pat programming language, which supports Mailbox types, and showed some of the relevant aspects of its type checker. We discussed how Mailbox types can be used to solve communication problems in concurrent programming and to ensure that communication is correct.
    * Developed tasks for the week and preparations for the next meeting: developed a plan of tasks for the week and what I need to prepare for the next meeting to ensure that the meeting is productive and progresses.
* **Week 2**
  * 1PM on Thursday
  * Meeting content:
    * Mailbox Forms:  supervisor reviewed mailbox concepts with me, emphasizing that they are attached to processes. This is a common communication mechanism in concurrent programming.
    * Future Example: supervisor used a future example to illustrate these concepts again, aiding my understanding of how Pat language works, especially in relation to mailboxes.
    * Answering Basic Questions: supervisor answered some fundamental questions I had about the syntax of the Pat language, helping me establish a foundational understanding.
    * Attempted Problem Resolution:  supervisor attempted to help me with an issue related to building "mbcheck." Due to time constraints, the problem wasn't resolved, and I plan to continue working on it in the next week.
* **Week 3**
  * 1PM on Thursday
  * Meeting content:
    * Question Clarification: addressed and clarified my questions and concerns.
    * Foundational Learning Materials: Guidance was provided on essential foundational materials to study for learning computer languages.
    * CEK Machine: explained the fundamental principles of the CEK machine, offering insights into its operation and purpose in computation.
    * Pat Language: focus on starting with let expressions as a foundational aspect.
    * Reduction Principles: The meeting included an exploration of reduction principles, with practical examples illustrated on a whiteboard, helping my understand this important computational concept.
* **Week 4**
  * 3:30PM on Thursday
  * Meeting content:
    * Abstract Syntax and Reduction Rules: This section explains about Abstract Syntax and Reduction Rules and the corresponding CEK machine. 
    * MBCheck Project Documentation: Learn about the documentation in the MBCheck project, including the Abstract Syntax and Reduction Rules that define the programming language.
    * Solving Symbolic Problems: Solving some symbolic problems Difference between CEK Machine and Pat rules: Understood the difference between CEK Machine and Pat rules.This involves different machines and rule sets in the programming language implementation.
* **Week 5**
  * 1:30PM on Thursday
  * Meeting content:
    * Discussed the code for the CEK machine that was written this week.
    * Taught me how to add functions in CEK machine.
    * How to add new code in the repository "mbcheck".
    * Also discussed some syntax (syntax) of the Pat language.
* **Week 6**
  * 1:30PM on Thursday
  * Meeting content:
    * Discussed the keywords of "Case" "Pair".
    * Discussed the Reduction rules of the rest in Pat, like "new" "spawn"...
* **Week 7**
* **Week 8**
* **Week 9**
* **Week 10**
* **Week 11 [PROJECT WEEK]**
* **Week 12 [PROJECT WEEK]**
