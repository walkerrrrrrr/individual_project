## Winter semester

* **Week 1**
  
  * 1PM on Tuesday
  * Meeting content:
    * The differences and advantages and disadvantages of Channel-Based Languages and Mailbox are discussed: in particular, Go and Erlang languages, which coordinate concurrent computation by means of explicit message passing. We compare the differences between channel-based languages (Go) and languages based on the Actor model (e.g., Erlang), including differences in message-passing methods, data locality, and so on.
    * The basic syntax of Erlang is briefly explained: we discuss the basic syntax and concepts of Erlang as a language that supports the Actor model. This included basic concepts such as the notion of Actor, message passing, and mailboxes (Mailbox).
    * Demonstrated a case study on Future : We demonstrated a case study on Future through sample code. In this case, we modeled a Future variable and showed how to handle message passing and state transitions in concurrent computation.
    * Introduced the Pat programming language's type checker: We explored the Pat programming language, which supports Mailbox types, and showed some of the relevant aspects of its type checker. We discussed how Mailbox types can be used to solve communication problems in concurrent programming and to ensure that communication is correct.
    * Developed tasks for the week and preparations for the next meeting: developed a plan of tasks for the week and what I need to prepare for the next meeting to ensure that the meeting is productive and progresses.
